                <h3>History</h3>
                <p class="p-about">
                    The West End Growing Grounds Association (WEGGA) was established in 2011 as a sub-committee of Paisley West & Central Community Council.
                    It leased two adjacent Renfrewshire Council sites in Sutherland Street and installed 70 raised beds for use by local residents.
                </p>
                <p class="p-about">
                    In 2018 the allotments were required for housing and the existing alternative Council green-field site was developed with Council grant aid and Sanctuary Housing work-in-kind.
                    The Association then became an independent registered charity (see constitution) and also provided off-street secure parking for local residents.
                </p>
                <p class="p-about">    
                    Aptly named “Sanctuary Garden”, its high-profile location on Paisley’s ring road attracts interest from passers-by and potential new members.

                <p class="p-about">
                    The West End Growing Grounds Association SCIO (Charity no. SC047768) provides raised bed growing grounds for the local communities in the West End of Paisley. A Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisation (SCIO), WEGGA aims to:
                </p>
                <ul class="crimson-text-regular">
                    <li>Prevent food poverty by improving availability of freshly grown food while increasing knowledge of nutrition, cookery, and horticulture.</li>
                    <li>Engage in educational activities that promote an understanding of horticulture and the nutritional benefits of local sustainable own-grown food production.</li>
                    <li>Encourage community development and cohesion by managing, improving, and rejuvenating spaces and buildings that allow access and use, primarily, for the enjoyment and benefit of members and the local community.</li>
                    <li>Improve community health and wellbeing by encouraging appreciation of, and interest and participation in, horticulture.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="p-about">In view of the economic effects of the pandemic, the board agreed once again not to increase fees for 2023-2024. This is despite considerable additional costs in ground maintenance and garden improvements.
                    Membership of WEGGA is free and gives access to communal activities, volunteering, and educational courses. To hire growing space, see our <a href="./Memberships.html" alt="link to memberships page">prices</a>.
